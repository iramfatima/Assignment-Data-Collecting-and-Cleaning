# Assignment-Data-Collecting-and-Cleaning

==================================================================
Assignment for Data Cleaning based on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
==================================================================

The data cleaning and summarization has been done on the based on the four steps mentioned in the assignment task. The main steps are listed below and also mentioned as comments in the R file.

==================================================================
1: Fisrt of all, I read the the test data file from the working directory of R Studio.
==================================================================
2: Read the feature file from the dataset
==================================================================
3: Assign colnames to testdata from features files so each column of the dataset can have meaningfull column name
==================================================================
4: Read activity file of test data in order to combine the data into one file
==================================================================
5: Read subject file of test data in orer to combine the data into one file
==================================================================
6: Combine the Subjectid, activity id and testdata into one dataframe 
==================================================================
7: Read the train data file
==================================================================
8: Assign namess to columns from features files so each column of the dataset can have meaningfull column name
==================================================================
9: Read activity file of train data in order to combine the data into one file
==================================================================
10: Read subject file of train data in order to combine the data into one file
==================================================================
11: Combine Subjectid, activity id and the train data into one data frame
==================================================================
12: Combined the test and train data into one data frame
==================================================================
13: Step one of assignment has been accoplised at this stage
==================================================================
14: Find the columns that are only have mena and standard
==================================================================
15: Extract only mean and std from the combined dataset
==================================================================
16: Step two of assignment has been accoplised at this stage
==================================================================
17: Replace the activity ID with the activity Lable
==================================================================
18: Step three of assignment has been accoplised at this stage
==================================================================
19: Take average of each variable for each activity and each subject
==================================================================
20: Step four of assignment has been accoplised at this stage
==================================================================
21: Write the final data on the disk inorder to upload it for submission
==================================================================
